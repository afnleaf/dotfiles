Simple configs for command line utlities.

- **Terminal**: Alacritty 
- **Multiplexer**: Tmux
- **Text Editor**: Neovim
- **Shell(s)**: Fish, Zsh, Bash

I should be setting up symlinks in my shell configs. Depends on the system which shell I use. This should realy just be a bash script that does it once?
